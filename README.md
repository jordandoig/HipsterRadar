# HipsterRadar

HipsterRadar is a revolutionary new app that gives the relative hipster concentration of an area based on map coordinates. The app takes coordinates from the user derived from an embedded google map and displays the relative hipster concentration in a simple vertical bar graph, and then pairs this graph with a carefully selected image representative of the hipster concentration. Should the user supply coordinates of an area with a particularly high hipster concentration, the app goes into hipster overload, abrasively warning the user to beware the high hipster concentration.

This skeleton of this app was made in HTML, it was styled in CSS with a lot of help from Bootstrap, and the functionality was added in a Javascript file with jQuery calls to the GoogleMaps and Yelp APIs. I designed the layout in a simple wireframe on a whiteboard, prepared user stories in PivotalTracker, prioritized them, and then got cracking throwing it all together.
